I need comprehensive Go tests written for the mage-x project with maximum parallel efficiency. Please analyze the
untested code, prioritize by criticality, and write tests using parallel workloads across multiple agents.

Focus on:
1. **Critical untested code** in pkg/mage/ namespace implementations
2. **Security-sensitive code** in pkg/security/ that lacks test coverage
3. **Interface implementations** and factory functions (New*Namespace patterns)
4. **Cross-platform compatibility tests** for build and command execution
5. **Performance-critical paths** that need benchmark tests

Requirements:
- Use **table-driven tests** with parallel execution (t.Parallel())
- Create **comprehensive test coverage** including edge cases and error paths
- Write **benchmark tests** for performance-critical functions
- Include **integration tests** for namespace interactions
- Add **fuzz tests** for input validation functions
- Ensure tests follow **mage-x architectural patterns** and security principles

Please coordinate across agents to maximize parallel execution and comprehensive coverage.
