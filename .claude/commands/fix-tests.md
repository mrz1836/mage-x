Your task is to use any sub agent that specializes in Go code to:

From the main project directory...

run: `mage lint`
run: `mage test`

Make sure all modules and packages are linted and tested, and that all tests pass.

If you find any issues, fix them and ensure all tests pass.

Run them again to confirm everything is fixed.
