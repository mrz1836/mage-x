**Key GitHub CLI Commands:**
- Repository: `gh repo list`, `gh repo view`, `gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`
- Pull Requests: `gh pr create`, `gh pr list`, `gh pr view`, `gh pr merge`, `gh pr review`
- Issues: `gh issue create`, `gh issue list`, `gh issue view`, `gh issue close`
- Releases: `gh release create`, `gh release upload`, `gh release view`
- Workflows: `gh workflow list`, `gh workflow run`, `gh workflow view`
