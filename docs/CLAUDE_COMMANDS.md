## Usage Patterns

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Simple command
/test

# With arguments
/fix lint

# With specific targets
/optimize performance
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Specific namespace testing
/test pkg/mage/security

# Comprehensive quality check
/quality full

# Dry-run release
/release dry-run
```

### Parallel Execution

Commands automatically leverage parallel agent execution where beneficial:

```
/quality full
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mage-x-linter     ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mage-x-test-finder ‚îú‚îÄ Parallel Phase 1
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mage-x-security    ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mage-x-analyzer    ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mage-x-architect   ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mage-x-benchmark   ‚îÄ‚îò
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Integrated Analysis ‚Üí Results
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Quality
Begin new features with `/quality quick` to understand the codebase state.

### 2. Test-Driven Development
Use `/test` before implementing features to establish test patterns.

### 3. Regular Security Scans
Run `/security deps` regularly to catch vulnerabilities early.

### 4. Pre-Release Validation
Always use `/release dry-run` before actual releases.

### 5. Fix Issues Promptly
Use `/fix all` after major changes to maintain code quality.

## Command Efficiency Tips

### Parallel Optimization
Commands are designed for parallel execution. Avoid sequential thinking:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Enables parallel analysis
/quality full

# ‚ùå Less optimal: Forces sequential execution
/test then /lint then /security
```

### Targeted Execution
Use arguments to focus agent efforts:

```bash
# Specific path testing
/test pkg/critical/auth

# Focused security scan
/security deps

# Quick quality check
/quality quick
```

### Agent Coordination
Let agents coordinate automatically rather than running them separately:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Coordinated analysis
/explain architecture

# ‚ùå Less optimal: Manual coordination
Run analyzer, then architect, then docs
```

## Integration with MAGE-X

All commands integrate seamlessly with MAGE-X build system:

- Respect `.mage.yaml` configuration
- Use mage commands where available
- Follow project conventions
- Maintain compatibility

## Performance Characteristics

| Command     | Agents Used | Parallel Phases | Typical Duration |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| `/test`     | 6           | 3               | 30-60s           |
| `/quality`  | 6           | 2               | 20-40s           |
| `/fix`      | 4           | 3               | 15-30s           |
| `/release`  | 6           | 3               | 45-90s           |
| `/security` | 4           | 3               | 25-45s           |

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
Ensure commands are in `.claude/commands/` directory.

### Agent Timeout
Some operations may take time. Agents will provide progress updates.

### Insufficient Permissions
Some commands require specific tool access. Check error messages for required permissions.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Custom command creation tools
- Command composition and pipelines
- Performance metrics tracking
- Team collaboration features
