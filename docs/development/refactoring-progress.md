- [ ] Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Week 2: Migration Wave 1 (File ops, Config)
- [ ] Week 3: Migration Wave 2 (Runners, Errors)
- [ ] Week 4: Polish & Documentation

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance ‚è≥
- [ ] Create `.golangci.yml`

## Detailed Task List

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Create directory structure for common packages
2. Define all interfaces in their respective packages
3. Implement FileOperator interface with default implementation
4. Create comprehensive tests for FileOperator
5. Set up mock generation

### Duplication Metrics to Track

| Pattern | Current Count | Target | Status |
|---------|--------------|---------|---------|
| File Operations | 20+ | 0 | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| JSON/YAML Marshal | 70+ | 0 | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| Config Loading | 5+ | 1 | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| Error Formatting | 522+ | <50 | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| Env Variables | 15+ | 0 | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| Path Building | 25+ | 0 | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| Logging Calls | 765 | <100 | ‚è≥ Not Started |

## Risk Log

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Breaking Changes | High | Interface-based design | ‚úÖ Mitigated |
| Performance Regression | Medium | Benchmarking | ‚è≥ Planned |
| Test Coverage Drop | Low | Incremental migration | ‚è≥ Planned |

## Decision Log

### 2025-01-19
- **Decision**: Use interface-based design for all common packages
- **Rationale**: Enables easy mocking and testing
- **Decision**: Start with file operations package
- **Rationale**: Highest duplication count and impact

## Notes

- All packages must be mockable for testing
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
- Zero linter errors is non-negotiable
- All tests must pass with race detector enabled
