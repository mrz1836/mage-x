## ADR-001: Type Naming Conflicts Resolution

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Active

### Context
During the interface refactoring, we discovered several type naming conflicts between the new interfaces.go file and existing code:

1. `BenchmarkResult` - Defined in both analytics.go and interfaces.go with different fields
2. `Environment` - Defined in both enterprise_config.go and interfaces.go  
3. `Release` - Defined in both release.go and interfaces.go
4. `ComplianceReport` - Defined in both security.go and interfaces.go
5. `SecurityPolicy` - Defined in both security.go and interfaces.go
6. `PolicyRule` - Defined in both security.go and interfaces.go
7. `PolicyResult` - Defined in both security.go and interfaces.go

### Decision
We will rename types in interfaces.go to avoid conflicts while maintaining clarity:

**Naming Convention**: Prefix interface-related types with 'I' for Interface:
- `BenchmarkResult` → `IBenchmarkResult` (interface version)
- `Environment` → `IEnvironment` (interface version)
- `Release` → `IRelease` (interface version)
- `ComplianceReport` → `IComplianceReport` (interface version)
- `SecurityPolicy` → `ISecurityPolicy` (interface version)
- `PolicyRule` → `IPolicyRule` (interface version)
- `PolicyResult` → `IPolicyResult` (interface version)

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Immediate compilation fixes without breaking existing code
- **Positive**: Clear distinction between interface types and implementation types
- **Negative**: Slight naming inconsistency (I-prefix pattern)
- **Future**: When migrating to use interfaces, we'll map implementation types to interface types

## ADR-002: Refactoring Strategy - Common Packages

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Active

### Context
The codebase has significant duplication:
- 522+ error formatting instances
- 70+ JSON/YAML marshal/unmarshal patterns
- 765 logging calls
- 25+ path building patterns
- 20+ file operations patterns

### Decision
Create common packages with interfaces for mockability:
1. `pkg/common/fileops` - File operations with FileOperator interface
2. `pkg/common/config` - Configuration with ConfigLoader interface
3. `pkg/common/env` - Environment with Environment interface
4. `pkg/common/paths` - Path building with PathBuilder interface
5. `pkg/common/errors` - Error handling with MageError interface

### Consequences
- **Positive**: 40-50% reduction in code duplication
- **Positive**: Improved testability through interfaces
- **Positive**: Consistent patterns across codebase
- **Negative**: Initial migration effort
- **Mitigation**: Gradual migration with feature flags

## ADR-003: Testing Strategy

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Active

### Context
Need comprehensive testing for refactored code with easy mocking capabilities.

### Decision
1. All common packages expose interfaces for mockability
2. Use mockgen for automatic mock generation
3. Create `pkg/testhelpers` with TestEnvironment struct
4. Minimum 80% test coverage for new packages
5. 100% coverage for error paths

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Easy to test all code paths
- **Positive**: Reduced test setup boilerplate
- **Positive**: Consistent testing patterns
- **Negative**: Additional mock maintenance
- **Mitigation**: Auto-generate mocks in CI

## ADR-004: Linting Standards

**Date**: 2025-01-19  
**Status**: Active

### Context
Need to ensure code quality and catch issues early.

### Decision
Implement strict linting with golangci-lint:
- Enable 20+ linters including security and style checks
- Cyclomatic complexity limit: 15
- Duplication threshold: 100 tokens
- Mandatory error checking
- Consistent naming conventions

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High code quality standards
- **Positive**: Catch bugs before runtime
- **Positive**: Consistent code style
- **Negative**: Initial cleanup effort
- **Mitigation**: Fix issues incrementally by package
